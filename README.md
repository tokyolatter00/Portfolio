# Programming Project Portfolio

This is a portfolio to showcase projects and programs I have created. 

## [C - Advanced Calculator](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Calculator)


### **Overview**

This calculator can accept a range of complicated mathematical expressions represented in a string. This calculator handles things like error handling, parenthesis, floating point numbers, negative numbers, etc. Input strings are analysed, parsed and evaluated to calculate the end result. 
  
### **Languages and Tools**

- C Programming Language
- Microsoft Visual Studio

## [Python - TCP Chatroom](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Python-Chat-Room)

### **Overview**

This is a simple TCP chatroom application with a server and client. A server can handle many clients, and responds to events like client connections and disconnections accordingly. The server also validates data sent from a client, if the server deems the data unacceptable it will not allow it. For example, a client is not allowed to send a message which is greater than 128 characters. Data is sent using JSON encoding and decoding. 

### **Languages and Tools**

- Python Programming Language
- Server-Client Networking
- JSON Encoding and Decoding
