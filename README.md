## [Python - TCP Chatroom](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Python-Chat-Room)

### **Overview**

This is a simple TCP chatroom application with a server and client. A server can handle many clients, and responds to events like client connections and disconnections accordingly. The server also validates data sent from a client, if the server deems the data unacceptable it will not allow it. For example, a client is not allowed to send a message which is greater than 128 characters. Data is sent using JSON encoding and decoding. 

### **Languages and Tools**

- Python Programming Language
- Server-Client Networking
- JSON Encoding and Decoding
