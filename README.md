# Programming Project Portfolio

This is a portfolio to showcase projects and programs I have created. I tried to include a different range of projects, and only tried to include projects I thought were interesting or fun. 

## [C - Advanced Calculator](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Calculator)

This calculator can accept a range of complicated mathematical expressions represented in a string. This calculator handles things like error handling, parenthesis, floating point numbers, negative numbers, etc. Input strings are analysed, parsed and evaluated to calculate the end result. 
  
## [C - Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Tic-Tac-Toe)

This is a single-player tic-tac-toe console game which allows the user to play against their computer. The program is able to detect when a player winners and end the game when that happens

## [C - Net Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Net-Tic-Tac-Toe)

This is a multiplayer tic-tac-toe console game which allows two clients to player against eachother over a TCP connection with a server in the middle. The program tells a client when it is their turn and lets them enter their position, it also updates the positions for each client so the clients know the move their opponent made. For game security, the server will only accept moves from clients if it is their turn. The server also validates who wins and loses. 

## [C# - Inventory Manager](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Inventory-Manager)

This is an inventory manager application created in C#. It is an example of how an inventory manager would be created on a local database. The user is able to add and remove inventory items to the inventory list, and is also able to set the amount of that inventory item which is in stock. This program also supports error handling, and informs the user when they are doing something wrong, more can be found about this on the repository for this application. 

### **Languages and Tools**

- C# Programming Language / .NET
- SQLite Database
- Windows Forms
- Microsoft Visual Studio

## [Python - TCP Chatroom](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Python-Chat-Room)

This is a simple TCP chatroom application with a server and client. A server can handle many clients, and responds to events like client connections and disconnections accordingly. The server also validates data sent from a client, if the server deems the data unacceptable it will not allow it. For example, a client is not allowed to send a message which is greater than 128 characters. Data is sent using JSON encoding and decoding. 

### **Languages and Tools**

- Python Programming Language
- Tkinter User Interface
- Server-Client Networking
- JSON Encoding and Decoding

## [Python - Contact Book](https://github.com/tokyolatter00/Contact-Book)

This is a contact book application created in Python. It showcases how a contact book would be created using a local database. The user can add and remove contacts to the database. This application also supports error handling, and informs the user when what they are doing is wrong.  

### **Languages and Tools**

- Python Programming Language
- Tkinter User Interface
